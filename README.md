### Corrected Python Script: `daily_email_report.py`

```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from datetime import datetime
import os

# Function to send an email
def send_email(subject, body, to_email, from_email, from_password, smtp_server, smtp_port):
    # Create message container
    msg = MIMEMultipart()
    msg['From'] = from_email
    msg['To'] = to_email
    msg['Subject'] = subject

    # Attach the message body
    msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))

    # Set up the SMTP server and send the email
    try:
        server = smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, smtp_port)
        server.starttls()  # Secure the connection
        server.login(from_email, from_password)
        text = msg.as_string()
        server.sendmail(from_email, to_email, text)
        print(f"Email sent successfully to {to_email}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to send email. Error: {e}")
    finally:
        server.quit()

# Function to generate the daily report (this is where you'd generate your custom report)
def generate_daily_report():
    # Example: Just returning the current date as the report for demonstration
    report = f"Daily Report - {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}\n"
    report += "Here is the content of the daily report."
    return report

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Email configuration
    to_email = "recipient@example.com"
    from_email = "youremail@example.com"
    from_password = os.getenv("EMAIL_PASSWORD")  # Best practice: use environment variables for sensitive data
    smtp_server = "smtp.gmail.com"
    smtp_port = 587

    # Generate the daily report
    report = generate_daily_report()

    # Send the email
    send_email(subject="Daily Report", body=report, to_email=to_email, from_email=from_email, from_password=from_password, smtp_server=smtp_server, smtp_port=smtp_port)
```

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Install Required Libraries:**
   Python’s built-in `smtplib` and `email` modules are used here, so no external libraries need to be installed.
   
   If you want to use environment variables for email credentials, you can use the `os` module, which is also part of Python's standard library.

2. **Set Up Email Credentials:**
   - You need an email address (e.g., Gmail) that will send the reports.
   - For Gmail, ensure **less secure app access** is enabled in your account or use an **App Password** if you're using 2-factor authentication (for enhanced security).

   Alternatively, you can store sensitive data like the email password using environment variables. For example:
   
   On Linux/macOS:
   ```bash
   export EMAIL_PASSWORD='yourpassword'
   ```
   
   On Windows:
   ```bash
   set EMAIL_PASSWORD=yourpassword
   ```

3. **How the Script Works:**
   - **`send_email` Function:** This function sets up an SMTP connection using the credentials and sends an email with the provided subject and body.
   - **`generate_daily_report` Function:** This is a placeholder for your actual daily report generation logic. You can modify this to suit the content of your report.
   - **Main Execution:** The script generates a daily report, and the `send_email` function sends it to the specified recipient.

4. **Scheduling the Script:**
   To automate this script to run daily, you need to schedule it.

   - **Linux/macOS: Use `cron`:**
     - Open the crontab editor:
       ```bash
       crontab -e
       ```
     - Add a line to run the script every day at 9:00 AM:
       ```bash
       0 9 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/daily_email_report.py
       ```

   - **Windows: Use Task Scheduler:**
     - Open **Task Scheduler**.
     - Create a new task and schedule it to run daily at a specific time.
     - Set the action to run the Python executable with your script as an argument:
       ```bash
       C:\path\to\python.exe C:\path\to\daily_email_report.py
       ```

5. **Running the Script Manually (Optional):**
   You can always run the script manually:
   ```bash
   python daily_email_report.py
   ```

### Notes:
- This script assumes you’re using Gmail as the SMTP provider. If you’re using a different email service, modify the `smtp_server` and `smtp_port` accordingly.
  - **For Gmail:** `smtp.gmail.com`, Port `587`
  - **For Outlook:** `smtp.office365.com`, Port `587`
  - **For Yahoo:** `smtp.mail.yahoo.com`, Port `465`

This script is highly customizable, and you can integrate it with other sources of data to generate more complex reports.
